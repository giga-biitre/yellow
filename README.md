 Look at the stars<br></br>
Look how they shine for you<br></br>
And everything you do<br></br>
Yeah, they were all <b>yellow</b><br></br>
I came along<br></br>
I wrote a song for you<br></br>
And all the things you do<br></br>
And it was called <b>Yellow</b><br></br>
So then I took my turn<br></br>
Oh, what a thing to have done<br></br>
And it was all <b>yellow</b><br></br>
Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones<br></br>
Turn into something beautiful<br></br>
And you know, you know I love you so<br></br>
You know I love you so<br></br>
I swam across<br></br>
I jumped across for you<br></br>
Oh, what a thing to do<br></br>
'Cause you were all <b>yellow</b><br></br>
I drew a line<br></br>
I drew a line for you<br></br>
Oh, what a thing to do<br></br>
And it was all <b>yellow</b><br></br>
And your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones<br></br>
Turn into something beautiful<br></br>
And you know, for you, I'd bleed myself dry<br></br>
For you, I'd bleed myself dry<br></br>
It's true<br></br>
Look how they shine for you<br></br>
Look how they shine for you<br></br>
Look how they shine for<br></br>
Look how they shine for you<br></br>
Look how they shine for you<br></br>
Look how they shine<br></br>
Look at the stars<br></br>
Look how they shine for you<br></br>
And all the things that you do<br></br>
